# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis  (Text Classification NLP) - Na√Øve Bayes
Overview
This workshop project focuses on the analysis of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset to perform sentiment analysis. The IMDB dataset, a collection of 50,000 reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), is a standard dataset used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for binary sentiment classification. For the sake of processing time we will only use a portion of the data to conduct the classification.

## Dataset Description
The IMDB dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews, in this project we will utilize only half the data provided. Each set has an equal number of positive and negative reviews, where each review is labeled as 'positive' if the movie is rated more than 6/10 and 'negative' otherwise. This dataset provides a substantial variety of text, making it an excellent resource for developing and testing machine learning models for sentiment analysis.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify a movie review as either positive or negative. We'll explore various NLP techniques, including text preprocessing, tokenization, vectorization, and the application of the Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm. 

## Tools and Technologies
* Python
* Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NLTK
* Machine Learning Models: Naive Bayes
